ITEM #: BLEACH-1

DESCRIPTION:
BLEACH-1 IS A FAILED EXPERIMENTAL PRION CURRENTLY STORED AT SITE CSFBT-1.
RESEARCH IS HIGHLY CLASSIFIED DUE TO SABOTAGE AND BREACH RISK.
ORIGINAL PURPOSE: HUMANOID ENHANCEMENT.

KNOWN TRAITS:
- 100% INFECTIOUS
- 100% LETHAL
- TRANSMISSION VIA MUCOUS MEMBRANES AND ALL BODILY FLUIDS
- NOT AIRBORNE
- NOT WATERBORNE

SYMPTOM PROGRESSION:
- MANIFESTATION WITHIN 6 HOURS POST-EXPOSURE
- INITIAL FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS WITH HIGH FEVER
- SEVERE DEMENTIA IN LATER STAGES
- COMA ONSET ~20 HOURS AFTER INITIAL SYMPTOMS
- COMA IS CONSIDERED CLINICAL DEATH

PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS:
- SPORADIC CELLULAR NECROSIS RESEMBLING GANGRENE
- SURVIVING TISSUE RETAINS ORIGINAL FUNCTION
- RED BLOOD CELLS SHOW INCREASED OXYGEN CAPACITY
- BLOOD FLOW SLOWED; MUSCLE ENDURANCE INCREASED
- NERVOUS AND MUSCULAR SYSTEMS FUNCTION DESPITE ORGAN FAILURE
- METABOLISM MAY DROP TO EXTREMELY LOW LEVELS
- SUBJECT MAY SURVIVE >10 YEARS WITHOUT NUTRITION

BEHAVIORAL DEGRADATION:
- CONDITIONED BEHAVIOR AND COGNITION SEVERELY DAMAGED
- LIMITED MOTOR FUNCTIONS REMAIN
- SUBJECT ATTRACTED TO SIGHTS, SOUNDS, AND ODORS OF HUMANS
- SUBJECT ATTEMPTS INGESTION UPON CONTACT

TERMINATION PROTOCOL:
- REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT CRANIAL TRAUMA

RESEARCH NOTE:
FURTHER EXPERIMENTS ARE ENCOURAGED.
EXTREME CAUTION ADVISED.
GOAL REMAINS ENHANCEMENT — NOT TERMINATION.
